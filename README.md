# TL;DR: quickstart
InstructIR takes as input an image and a human-written instruction for how to improve that image. The neural model performs all-in-one image restoration. InstructIR achieves state-of-the-art results on several restoration tasks including image denoising, deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and (low-light) image enhancement.

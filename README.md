High-Quality Image Restoration Following Human Instructions

A one-click installer for [InstructIR](https://github.com/mv-lab/InstructIR).

The gradio is demo is missing 2 images, so it didn't start. 
I copied two other images from the repo, so the server starts, but with different images for the bottom two in the demo.
Should still work for all your own images. 

# TL;DR: quickstart
InstructIR takes as input an image and a human-written instruction for how to improve that image. The neural model performs all-in-one image restoration. InstructIR achieves state-of-the-art results on several restoration tasks including image denoising, deraining, deblurring, dehazing, and (low-light) image enhancement.
